## As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I executed a full-cycle database migration project involving the transfer of structured data from a MySQL environment to PostgreSQL. The objective was to seamlessly replicate schema and data while ensuring complete data integrity across both platforms.
Key steps and responsibilities included:
-  Schema Translation: Analyzed MySQL schemas and mapped them to compatible PostgreSQL data types and constraints
-  Data Export & Import: Used CSV exports, mysqldump, and pgloader to transfer datasets efficiently
-  Tool Utilization: Leveraged tools like pgloader and custom Python scripts for automation and validation
-  Integrity Checks: Performed row counts, key constraints, and randomized sample comparisons to ensure data consistency
-  Error Resolution: Debugged migration issues such as data type mismatches, encoding problems, and index re-creation
This task sharpened my expertise in relational database architecture, cross-platform SQL compliance, and meticulous testing to guarantee migration fidelity.
